# Electron React
A clean template used for creating electron applications with [react](https://reactjs.org/), [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [material ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), and [level](https://github.com/Level/level) as the main file system based database.

This template also has support for react dev tools to make development a little bit easier.

## Setting Up
Simply run the following command
```
npm install
```

## Usage
The following scripts came directly from this youtube video.

### Run Development
To run the development version, simply execute `npm run electron:serve`.
This will run react on port `3000` and electron will expect react on `http://localhost:3000`

### Building
To run the build tool, simply type `npm run electron:build`
